Missorting of cathepsin D in GARP-depleted cells results from accumulation of recycling MPRs in a population of light, small vesicles downstream of endosomes.
Data show that transcription of the putative tumor suppressor gene HCCS1 requires binding of ETS-2 to its consensus near the transcription start site; observations provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of HCCS1 transcription regulation
Amphipathic tail-anchoring peptide (ATAP) targets specifically to mitochondria, and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis that does not require Bax or Bak.
Golgi associated retrograde protein complex, consisting of the Vps52, Vps53, and Vps54 proteins, shows significant conservation between various species but diversification and specialization result in important differences in human cells.

A canonical nuclear import sequence in the N-terminus of Gemin4 was identified.
Gemin3 and Gemin4 function in Sm core assembly and correlate the activity of this pathway with Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
zinc-finger proteins were identified as HCAP1-interacting proteins
A haplotype of HCAP1 with minor alleles at 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms may be related to cancer susceptibility: its expression causes up-regulation of genes involved in cell growth and down-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis and DNA repair.

The majority of the cases of Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas had strong nuclear p53 positivity
Gastric cancer patients who had low FBXW7 expression levels and p53 mutation had a distinctively poor prognosis in comparison with other subgroups.
describes a third abnormal response pattern characterized by failure of p21 protein accumulation despite a normal p53 protein response
JFK promotes p53 turnover through assembly of an SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) complex, revealing a pathway for the control of p53 degradation and providing a link between the SCF complex and p53 regulation.
results also provide a plausible explanation for the evolutionary positive selection of some alleles in the p53 pathway and demonstrate the alleles in the p53 pathway as a good example of antagonistic pleiotropy
Results suggest that prevalent haplotypes within the TP53 gene may modulate CRC risks in the population.
