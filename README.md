GnomeSurfer2.0-Sur40
====================
To complete your install, you will need to download the genome source files from NCBI, the latest can be found here: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/.

If that is a little confusing, you can also download the zipped Genomes file here: http://cs.wellesley.edu/~hcilab/GnomeSurferData/

The file should be extracted and put in the root Data folder.
